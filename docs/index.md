## Elevator Pitch

AutoChess Classic is a strategy game that reimagines traditional chess as an auto-battler, where players focus on planning, piece combinations, and positioning while battles resolve automatically. It is designed for both casual strategy players who want quick, accessible matches and chess enthusiasts looking for a fresh take on familiar mechanics. The game addresses the problem of long, complex chess matches by offering short sessions that still preserve strategic depth. What makes AutoChess Classic unique is its combination of classic chess pieces with roguelike progression and data-driven balancing, ensuring high replayability and evolving gameplay. Matches typically last under 10 minutes, making the game well suited for modern, time-constrained players.
